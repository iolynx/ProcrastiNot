# <img src="public/icons/icon_48.png" width="45" align="left"> Procrastinot

An intelligent extension to detect & prevent procrastination.

## Features
Procrastinot uses an "idea" based whitelisting, as opposed to a website based white/blacklisting you see on other productivity extensions. <br/>
It uses AI to weigh the text content on the webpage you're accessing, and closes any tabs that classify as a "distraction". 

- Customizable "idea" whitelists
- Built in Timer
- Video Support (coming soon)
